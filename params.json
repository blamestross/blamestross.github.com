Ideally we should do our best to insure that our line of intelligent life continues.\r\n\r\n- We should focus on what we can do now, to provide our ancestors with the tools to preform this task later. This discussion is a huge part of that.\r\n\r\n- Diversity is robust. We are not trying to save our own Nation, Race, or creed. We are trying to ensure that as many populations and cultures of humanity exist as possible for as long as possible. We all must concede that _no culture is optimally fit to surivial_ (http://www.no-free-lunch.org/)\r\n",
